# meltpond-cascades
Cellular automaton describing network of filling, draining and interacting melt ponds on ice shelves

MATLAB functions encoding model are: meltponds_nonconserve.m, meltponds_nbrlist.m, RndPondDist.m
MATLAB scripts used to make figures in Robel & Banwell, GRL, 2019: Meltpond_CA_fig2.m, Meltpond_CA_fig3.m, Meltpond_CA_fig4.m

A GIF example of a simulation (with pond depth in filled circles, more blue being deeper, and ice strength in squares, with grayer being more damaged) with D = 4, k_0 = 4, A = 1, P = 1:
